# infinite-isp

## Overview
Infinite-isp is a collections of camera pipeline modules implemented at the application level for converting an input RAW image from an sensor to an output RGB image. Infinite-isp aims to contain simple to complex algorithms at each modular level.

## Objectives
The project aims to produce outputs that are fine tuned to best possible results with the algorithms implemented at each module level. The project aims to have both conventional and deep learning state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in a single project enabling a clean comparison between the two. The `infinite` in the name is just to depict that this project has no bounds to ideas and is aimed to contain any algorithm that improves the overall results of the pipeline regardless of their complexity.

### Color Correction Matrix

Since the color correction matrix is tuned offline and is stored in the ISP as register parameters the current module implements the application of color correction matrix provided in the `config.yml` file.

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `yaml`

## FAQ
**Why is it named infinite-isp?**

ISPs are hardware dependent. In them algorithms are limited to perform to their best because of hardware limitations. Infinite-isp tends to somewhat remove this limitation and let the algorithms perform to the full potential targeting best results. 

**Will inifnite-isp also contain algorithms that involve machine learning?**

Yes definitely this is mainly because it is seen that machine learning models tend to perform much better results as compared to conventional models. The plan is as follows

- The release `v0.x` till `v1.0` will involve buildng a basic ISP pipelne at conventional level. 

- The release `v1.0` will have all camera pipeline modules implemented at conventional level. `v1.x.x` releases will have all the necessary improvements of these conventional algorithms till release `v2.0`

- From release `v2.0` infinite-isp will start implementing machine learning models for specific algorithms. 

- Release `v3.0` will have infinite-isp having both conventional and deep learning algorithms (not for all pipeline modules but for specific ones)
