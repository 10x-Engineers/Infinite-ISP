# Infinite-ISP
Infinite-ISP is a one stop solution for all your ISP development needs - from algorithms to an FPGA prototype and associated firmware, tools, etc. Its primary goal is to offer a unified platform that empowers ISP developers to accelerate ISP innovation. It includes a complete collection of camera pipeline modules written in Python, an FPGA bit-stream & the associated firmware for the implementation of the pipeline on the Kria KV260 development board and lastly a stand-alone Python based Tuning tool application for the pipeline.  The main components of the Infinite-ISP project are listed below:

# Infinite-ISP_AlgorithmDesign: A Python-based Model for ISP Algorithm Development
Infinite-ISP is a collections of camera pipeline modules implemented at the application level for converting an input RAW image from a sensor to an output RGB image. Infinite-isp aims to contain simple to complex algorithms at each modular level.

ISP pipeline for `infinite-isp v1.0`

## Objectives
Many open-source ISPs are available over the internet. Most of them are developed by individual contributors, each having its own strengths. This project aims to centralize all the open-source ISP development to a single place enabling all the ISP developers to have a single platform to contribute. Infinite-isp will not only contain the conventional algorithms but aims to contain state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms as well enabling a clean comparison between the two. This project has no bounds to ideas and is aimed to contain any algorithm that improves the overall results of the pipeline regardless of their complexity.

## FAQ
**Why is it named infinite-isp?**

ISPs are hardware dependent. In them algorithms are limited to perform to their best because of hardware limitations. Infinite-isp tends to somewhat remove this limitation and let the algorithms perform to the full potential targeting best results. 

**Will inifnite-isp also contain algorithms that involve machine learning?**

Yes definitely this is mainly because it is seen that machine learning models tend to give perform much better results as compared to conventional models. The plan is as follows

- The release `v0.x` till `v1.0` will involve buildng a basic ISP pipelne at conventional level. 

- The release `v1.0` will have all camera pipeline modules implemented at conventional level. **This release will mostly contain algorithms that can be easily ported to hardware ISPs** 

- `v1.x.x` releases will have all the necessary improvements of these conventional algorithms till release `v2.0`

- From release `v2.0` infinite-isp will start implementing machine learning models for specific algorithms. 

- Release `v3.0` will have infinite-isp having both conventional and deep learning algorithms (not for all pipeline modules but for specific ones)
